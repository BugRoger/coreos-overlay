Hello World!
The discussion view starts with the pull request's original title and description and then captures additional activity to display chronologically from there. Any of the following types of activity are captured as they happen:

Comments left on the pull request itself.
Additional commits pushed to the pull request's branch.
File and line notes left on any of the commits included in the pull request's range.
Pull request comments are Markdown compatible, so you can embed images, use pre-formatted text blocks, and other formatting supported by Markdown.
